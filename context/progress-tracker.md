# Progress Tracker

Update this file whenever the current phase, active feature, or implementation state changes.

## Current Phase

- Feature 04: Project Dialogs

## Current Goal

- Build the /editor Home screen with New Project CTA, implement Create/Rename/Delete Project dialogs, and add sidebar project item actions (rename/delete for owned projects) backed by mock data.


## Completed

Feature 01: Design System — shadcn/ui installed and configured for Tailwind v4, dark-only theme tokens in globals.css, Button/Card/Dialog/Input/Tabs/Textarea/ScrollArea components added to components/ui/, lucide-react installed, lib/utils.ts cn() helper in place. TypeScript compiles clean.

Feature 02: Editor Chrome — EditorNavbar (fixed top bar with PanelLeftOpen/PanelLeftClose toggle) and ProjectSidebar (fixed overlay, slides from left, Projects title + close button, My Projects/Shared tabs with empty states, New Project button) added to components/editor/. Dialog pattern confirmed ready via existing components/ui/dialog.tsx. TypeScript and ESLint clean.

Feature 03: Auth — @clerk/ui installed. ClerkProvider wraps root layout with dark theme from @clerk/ui/themes, overriding appearance variables using CSS tokens (no hardcoded colors). proxy.ts at project root uses clerkMiddleware + createRouteMatcher to protect all routes except /sign-in and /sign-up (resolved from NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL / NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL env vars). Sign-in and sign-up pages use a minimal two-panel layout (left panel with logo/tagline/feature list hidden on mobile, right panel with centered Clerk form). app/page.tsx redirects authenticated users to /editor and unauthenticated users to /sign-in. UserButton added to EditorNavbar right section. app/editor/page.tsx shell created with sidebar state management.

Feature 04: Project Dialogs — hooks/use-project-dialogs.ts manages dialog/form/loading state and mock project data (CRUD operations on local state). components/editor/project-dialogs.tsx renders Create (name + live slug preview), Rename (prefilled, auto-focus, Enter submits), and Delete (destructive confirm) dialogs. ProjectSidebar updated with project item list showing rename/delete actions on hover/focus for owned projects only, shared projects shown without actions, mobile backdrop scrim added. app/editor/page.tsx updated with centered home screen (heading, description, New Project button) wired to Create dialog. TypeScript and ESLint clean.
